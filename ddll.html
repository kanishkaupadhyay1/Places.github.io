<h1> ABOUT DISNEY LAND </h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Disneyland, amusement park in Anaheim, California, featuring characters,
<br>
 rides, and shows based on the creations of Walt Disney and the Disney Company.
<br>
 Though its central building, the Sleeping Beauty Castle, is modeled on Germany's
<br>
 Neuschwanstein Castle, it is an unmistakable icon of American popular culture. </h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>  Disneyland, the only theme park designed and built under the direct
<br>
 supervision of Walt Disney, opened on Sunday, July 17, 1955. Construction
<br>
 lasted for exactly one year, and cost only $17 million to complete.
